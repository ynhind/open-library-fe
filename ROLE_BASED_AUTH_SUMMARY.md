## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Admin User Login

1. Login with admin credentials
2. Should redirect to `/admin` dashboard
3. Navigation should show admin menu items
4. Should display "Admin" badge in user menu
5. All admin routes should be accessible

### Test Case 2: Regular User Login

1. Login with regular user credentials
2. Should redirect to `/` home page
3. Navigation should show standard user menu items
4. Should display "Member" badge in user menu
5. Admin routes should be inaccessible (redirect to home)

### Test Case 3: Unauthorized Access

1. Access `/admin` without login
2. Should redirect to login page
3. Access `/admin` as regular user
4. Should redirect to home page

### Test Case 4: Role-Based Menu Display

1. Check desktop navigation for role-specific items
2. Check mobile menu for role-specific items
3. Verify visual indicators match user role
4. Test menu item functionality

## ðŸ“± User Experience

## ðŸ”’ Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in â†’ Backend validates credentials
2. Success â†’ Backend returns user data including role
3. Frontend stores user data and token
4. Role-based redirection occurs
5. Navigation updates based on role

### Route Protection

1. AdminRoute component checks for valid token
2. Validates user role from stored data
3. Redirects unauthorized users
4. Maintains protection across page refreshes

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Role Management**: Add ability to change user roles
2. **Permissions**: Implement granular permissions within admin roles
3. **Audit Logging**: Track admin actions
4. **Session Management**: Enhanced token refresh and validation
5. **Multi-role Support**: Support for multiple roles per user
